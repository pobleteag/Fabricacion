Antonio Gómez Poblete
---------------------


Hi, my name is Antonio, but my friends call me Toni. I'm twenty-five and I'm a student and a IT technician of UCLM.
I live in Ciudad Real now, but I'm from Aranjuez, a town of Madrid. I have two sister and I don`t have any brothers.
My father is a businessman and my mother helps him. 

In my free time I like reading books, listening music, watching a film, doing a few sport, going out with my friends .... Some of my favorite singers are Freddy Fercury, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and  my favorite writers are Edgar Allan Poe and Mario Benedetti. 

In the future I would like to invent some that changes our live and I would like to travel around the world with some friend.

In the last summer I did a lot of thing, I did the Santiago's way  from Tui, a small and  very nice town near Portugal, to Santiago in one week. After I went to the beach in Conil de la Frontera, a small town of Cadiz, with my friends. we got up to the bed very late and we went to beach  where we drank some beer. At night we were going to discos until dawn.

Other week I went to Valencia for the Iron Maire's concert, and  other weekend I went to Daimiel  for Joaquin Sabina's concert.
For the end I went to Alicante a week, where I went to Terra Mítica Park and I watched the film toy Story 3.
